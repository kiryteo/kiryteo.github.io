 There are a lot of exciting things in progress! I'm more inclined towards <a target="_blank" href="https://www.convergentresearch.org/our-fros">FROs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/">Charter cities</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightTechTree/">Longevity space</a>. In reading interests, I spend most of my time on substacks and maintain a rabbit hole of reading rabbit holes <a target="_blank" href="https://t.co/NERTqXiOoS">here</a>. I keep an eye on the stuff from the Foresight institute https://foresight.org/, The Overedge Catalog https://arbesman.net/overedge/, and the Trailblazers list https://trailblazerlist.xyz/. I constantly fail to go through all my Twitter bookmarks (R.I.P. browser tabs and bookmarks). I spend time thinking about interactions in society from a first and third-person view (more on this soon). I use Twitter as a resource (adding a post on this soon) and frequently curate the people I follow, which helps maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio.
