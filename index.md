 Hello, I currently work at the <a target="_blank" href="https://alleninstitute.org/division/cell-science/">Allen Institute for Cell Science</a>. I graduated with M.Sc. in Computer Science from Simon Fraser University working in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/">Medical Image Analysis group</a>, under the supervision of Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh. I worked on structural analysis of Endoplasmic Reticulum as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NanoscopyAI">NanoscopyAI</a> collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="https://cps.med.ubc.ca/faculty1/nabi/">Prof. Robert Nabi</a> at the University of British Columbia (<a target="_blank" href="https://summit.sfu.ca/item/38530">M.Sc. thesis</a>). Previously, I was a visiting scholar at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.embl.de/">EMBL Heidelberg</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/kreshuk/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60028565">Anna Kreshuk's</a> group where I worked on localization of Kinetochores (proteins in cell division process).
 Before that, I worked at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cinam.univ-mrs.fr/cinam/en/">CNRS CINAM</a> in Marseille, France as Research Engineer (contrat à durée déterminée) on development of automated pipeline for detection and classification of Red Blood Cells from blood flow recordings (prototype for <a target="_blank" href="https://icovell.fr/">ICOVELL</a> spin-off). I completed my undergrad in Computer Engineering at <a target="_blank" href="https://pict.edu/">Pune Institute of Computer Technology</a>, University of Pune, Pune, India.
