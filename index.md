 Hello, I am a MSc student/ research assistant in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/">MIA group</a> at Simon Fraser University, Canada, under the supervision of Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh. I'm working on ER (Endoplasmic Reticulum) data analysis as part of the SMLM collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="https://cps.med.ubc.ca/faculty1/nabi/">Prof. Robert Nabi</a> at the University of British Columbia. Previously, I was a visiting scholar at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.embl.de/">EMBL Heidelberg</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/kreshuk/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60028565">Anna Kreshuk's</a> group where I worked on localization of Kinetochores (proteins in cell division process).
 Before that, I worked at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cinam.univ-mrs.fr/cinam/en/">CNRS CINAM</a> in Marseille, France as Research Engineer (contrat à durée déterminée) on development of automated pipeline for detection and classification of Red Blood Cells from blood flow recordings (prototype for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cinam.univ-mrs.fr/cinam/en/valorisation/startup/">ICOVELL</a> spin-off). I completed my undergrad in Computer Engineering at <a target="_blank" href="https://pict.edu/">Pune Institute of Computer Technology</a>, University of Pune, Pune, India.
